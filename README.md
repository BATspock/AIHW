<br />
For this assignment we applied AI search techniques to solve sophisticated 3D mazes.
Each 3D maze is a grid of points with (x,y,z) locations, there are 18 actions our agent can make. The program should output the **optimal** path (according to the search algorithm).

## Homework 2
Little-GO agent on a 5x5 GO board <br />

<br />
This assignment was open-ended and allowed us to use any AI search, game playing, or reinforcement learning technique we desired. I decided to implement a simple minimax algorithm.

The easiest way to ensure this is to make sure you are using mini-batches for your forward and backward passes. If you understand the math, its a pretty simple jump to just use matrices instead of single datapoints.
I used a very simple model and got satisfactory results. Implemented Batch normalization and momentum.
